  "overview": "Designed specifically for a field experience at the Museum of Osteology (or the Perot Museum Hall of Life), this curriculum consists of 10 high-intensity, 20-minute rotational stations. Students utilize extensive skeletal collections to explore comparative anatomy, forensic anthropology, and evolutionary biology. Unlike a passive tour, this is a structured academic 'decathlon' where student groups rotate through specific exhibit zones to collect data, analyze skeletal adaptations, and solve biological riddles.",
  "prerequisites": "Completion of High School Biology I is recommended but not required. Familiarity with basic anatomical terms (cranium, pelvis, vertebrae) is helpful.",
