  "overview": "A rigorous, federal grant-compliant STEM curriculum designed for Upward Bound (UB) and UB Math & Science (UBMS) programs. This field curriculum utilizes the controlled environments of PinStack facilities (Bowling Lanes, Laser Tag Arena, High Ropes Course) as active physics and biology laboratories. The curriculum is structured to justify costs under 2 CFR 200 by transforming recreational equipment into scientific apparatus for measuring momentum, friction, infrared signal processing, and physiological stress responses. It aligns directly with Texas TEKS and federal objectives to improve standardized test performance in Math and Science.",
