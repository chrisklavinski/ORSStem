  "overview": "A refined, high-intensity rotation curriculum designed for UB/UBMS students in Texas (Dallas, Tarrant, Johnson counties). This curriculum breaks down complex hydrodynamics and environmental engineering concepts into 20 distinct, rapid-fire micro-modules (sprints). Students rotate through stations at the Waco Surf facility, covering Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Engineering in 20-30 minute intervals. The curriculum is strictly aligned with HEA Title IV regulations for allowable costs and services, providing rigorous academic instruction in a field setting.",
